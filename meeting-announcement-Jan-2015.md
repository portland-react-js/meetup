###Greetings fellow Reagents!

We are looking forward to our first official ReactJS user group. Dave and Eric from Idealist.org will be sharing some interesting stuff (details below) with us, and we're hoping to have one additional talk. Please let us know if you're interested in speaking/presenting. We'd like to have at least a few lightning talks as well. I have a feeling this will fill up fast, so please RSVP if you would like to attend this event.

Our first meeting will be held at Idealist.org's Portland office located at 209 SW Oak St, Portland OR 97204. Doors will be open at 6pm. Food and beverages will be provided, with vegan/GF options available. Please come at 6 to get refreshed and hopefully have a few minutes to mingle so we can be ready to start promptly at 6:30pm.

If you are new to our group, Welcome! If you would like to get more involved or hear what we're talking about, we'd like to invite you to [join our google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/portland-reactjs) to join the conversations or start a new one. Also, please take a look at our [code of conduct](https://github.com/portland-react-js/meetup/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) which let's you know what we think "being excellent to each other" should look and feel like.

##Talks: 
###Notes on the Design of Components (Dave McCabe)
Dave will discuss what idealist.org has learned about designing React components, specifically techniques for promoting simplicity, reuse, statelessness, and separation of concerns, and for dealing with asynchrony.

###Isomorphic Webpack Hot Module Replacement Boilerplate (Eric O'Connell)
- Do you want to serve fully-rendered HTML from your React application? 
- Do you want near-instant feedback in your browser as soon as you edit your React components? 
- How about CSS? 

This talk will give the starting point for a very nice dev environment using the webpack Hot Module Replacement feature. It will include a (trivial) Express app that renders the entire React component hierarchy which will then be hydrated on the client. Variations shown will include serving API requests out of the same app, and shared client/server routing.

###TBD / Lightning talks
Get in touch with us if you'd like to share your experiences!
